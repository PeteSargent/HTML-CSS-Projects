# HTML-CSS-Projects
## About
Hey there, this repository is where I've stored the various HTML and CSS projects that were performed while completing assignments from the HTML and CSS Course from The Tech Academy. A lot of the folders and files in this repository were for the purposes are practice and demonstration. Some are so basic to only utilize html, while others may demonstrate something more advanced like a Nav bar utilizing CSS. You might find something that looks like a complete homepage or find something resembling a mass of text, random images, a singular table about dwarves or a link to a rotating Seal. In a nutshell, this is basically a collection of files created for the sake of practice and learning, I hope you get laugh or two from it.
