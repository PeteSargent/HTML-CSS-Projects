				<h1>A <strong>GOOD</strong> Video Game Movie Adaptation, is it possible?</h1>
				<p>This article will be discussing movie adaptaions for Video Games and my idea for one that could succeed in being a good one.

			<p>Adaptations in general can be hit or miss since there are certain factors at play that either work with or against the undertaking in the first place. 
			For instance, if one were adapting a book to a screenplay, one has to deal with the reality of condensing the story and scenes to fit inside of an average of 2 or so hours. 
			This, of course, means one has to cut corners in some places and leave things out, which isn't fun for fans of the original work, but I think we're all use to it by now.
			Then there's whether or not the one making the movie is well versed on its source material and has a good grasp on how characters would act or how a scene should look or even determining which scenes are more important to keep in than others for the sake of time constraints.
			When a movie has a balance proper execution and fidelity to source material, it can be very satisifying for everyone involved, fans or otherwise. But when done haphazardly, or straight-up without any care as to whether it's done right or not, it can be very dissapointing.
			And then there's times when there's just no pleasing some people; lets not worry about that, though.

			<p>Very shortly we'll get into what I consider to be the correct way to go about producing a good Video Game movie adaptation, or at the very least one that's trying.</p>
			
			<h2>The Problem with Video Game Movies</h2>
			<p>Some of you may recognize, watched or heard of the movies shown below; some of you likely played their source material. 
			If you've played AND watched these, then you're aware of the disparity between Game and Movie and know exactly why picked them as visual aids for this topic. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65uNCLBTje0&ab_channel=cheesymovienight">Even the TV Show did a better job at representation.</a> <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkWYP95WbbY&ab_channel=cheesymovienight">Er, well, sort of.</a></p>

			In brief, they aren't done with fidelity to the source material. Quite a few video game movie adaptations, if not most, have this problem: the one's making it don't place enough importance on "getting things right"
			than they do simply hashing out a production (pics related). There have been enough examples of this happening to form a sort of stigma that "Video Game movies will always suck". With this concept in mind, it's not hard to wonder:

			<h2>How Does One Make a Good Video Game Movie Adaptation?</h2>
			<p>A few years ago, back when I was in California for a time, I was eating lunch with one of my coworkers. I don't recall the exact wording of the question I posed to him, but it went something on the order of,
			"If you had to make a movie adaptation for a video game, how would you make it not suck and what genre of movie would it be." I believe this also included would it be animated and if so, what form of animation would it be?
			Honestly, it was a head scratcher as to what games would even work in terms of being adapted, but it also seemed so simple as to the approach. Every game, more or less, already <strong>HAS</strong> a story, so thats like, half the work done for you already.
			Thing is how would you go about adapting that story to a movie? Well, somehow I landed on the idea the MediEvil, on the Playstation 1, would be my pick and I had a pretty good idea of how the movie would go.
