			<h1>The Commander's Rant</h1>
			<p>Hey everybody! <span style="color:#8B0000;font-style:italic">JEEZ</span> I guess we forgot to talk to dear old commander... <span style="font-size:20px;text-decoration:underline;color:#8B0000">After an op.</span><br>
			Let me explain to you what it was like being commander of that op. "Hey I need to get<br>
			some air assets somewhere." What? The pilot disconnected so we don't have an air asset?<br>
			Okay, that's fine... Alpha why don't you go over there? OH, Alpha QUIT. So I have half<br>
			a squad without a leader. Okay. Let's uh... Let's send someone to support Charlie&nbsp;squad<br>
			who has been waiting 30 minutes for their assistance. OH, Delta squad GOT INTO GO&nbsp;KARTS...<br>
			AND DESTROYED BRAVO&nbsp;SQUAD. I GOTTA HAIL PEOPLE AND TELL THEM TO GO PLACES... <br>
			And I can't! Because they're dead! Or they're not on long range! Phillipe turns his radio<br>
			off when he gets out of the vehicle because <span style="font-style:italic;color:#2F4F4F">"Oh, I don't like having both my long ranges on!"</span>
			<p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>
			I can't <span style="font-weight:bold">talk</span> to you if you're out of your vehicle and your long range isn't on!<br>
			What is... oh my go... <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8B0000">THERE'S NO LOGISTICS TEAM!</span> I can't get assets from one side of<br>
			the island to the other, because there's <em>no one to move the assets!</em> So I have to drive<br>
			all the way back, get the assets, and bring them back over by myself. And then all of<br>
			Alpha becomes my&mdash; part of my squad, so then we become logistics, so we have to <br>
			drive back and forth moving things, and then people try and tell me to get out of my<br>
			vehicle so I can talk to them, when they don't have anything important to say!
